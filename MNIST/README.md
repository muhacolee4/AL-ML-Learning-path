# Problem Statement:

The aim of this code is to build a machine learning model that can classify images of handwritten digits into their respective numerical values. The dataset used for this task is the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

# Documentation:

The code first imports the required libraries, including TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The MNIST dataset is then loaded using the TensorFlow Keras library. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, each containing images and their respective labels.

The code then proceeds with preprocessing the data by normalizing the pixel values of the images. This is done to ensure that the pixel values fall within a common range, making it easier for the model to learn and generalize.

Next, a feedforward neural network model is built using the TensorFlow Keras Sequential API. The model has three dense layers, with the first layer being a Flatten layer that flattens the 2D input images into a 1D array. The two hidden layers have 128 neurons each and use the ReLU activation function. The output layer has 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9) and uses the softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the classes.

The model is then compiled using the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric for evaluation. The summary of the model is printed to the console, which provides information about the number of parameters in the model and the layer-wise architecture of the model.

Finally, the model is trained on the training data for 50 epochs using the fit() method. During training, the model learns to minimize the loss function and maximize the accuracy on the training data. The trained model can then be used to predict the classes of new images in the test set.
